Students: Ian Lee & Anh Ho & Miles Whitaker

Instructor: Caterina Paun

# Frontend Application: Data Retrieval & Visualization

This frontend application seamlessly integrates with two distinct APIs, prioritizing efficient data retrieval. It excels in gracefully handling data anomalies and automatically retries API requests when necessary, ensuring a dependable data-fetching process.

## Data Visualization

We leverage the powerful Chart.js library to create visually appealing charts and graphs, enhancing the user experience.

## User Behavior Insights

Our application utilizes cookies and caching mechanisms to track frequently searched words and phrases, providing valuable insights into user behavior.

## Project Organization

The project is meticulously organized within a Git repository, offering effective version control, collaboration, and enhanced security.

## Authentication

Notably, we've implemented API login authentication through Auth0, enhancing security and user identity verification.

## Deployment

We are pleased to announce the successful deployment of the application, making it accessible and ready for real-world use. You can find the project within the main branch of our repository.


Our project has been done in the main branch.
